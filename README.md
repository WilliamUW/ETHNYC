# 🛡 Reputable 

#### Mission: Provide investors with an effective, yet simple interface to dispute publicy visible transactions

## 💡 Inspiration 

**There are no good ways to determine whether a fund is trustworthy or to dispute management of a fund. Just recently, in 2021, former Make-A-Wish Iowa CEO plead guilty to embezzling nearly $41,000. This is not an isolated case- other headlines suggest that this is a widespread issue:

* "FTC wants AmeriDebt founder to refund $172 million" (Ambrose 2005)
* "fAs charitable cheating rises, so does cost to taxpayers" (USA Today 2005) 
* "Tax Abuse Rampant in Nonprofits, IRS Says" (Crenshaw 2005) 

Although fund management can be especially helpful when it comes to tracking charities and non-profits, investors should also have the ability to audit fund management with any type of organization. So how do we ensure capital is confidently deployed? With **Reputable**! 🤖
