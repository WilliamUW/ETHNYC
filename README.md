# üõ° Reputable 

#### Mission: Provide investors and donors with a one-stop shop to conduct market research, deploy capital, and audit fund management.

## üí° Inspiration 

**There are no easy ways to determine whether a fund is trustworthy or to dispute mismanagement of a fund.** Just recently, in 2021, former Make-A-Wish Iowa CEO plead guilty to embezzling $40,000+ USD. This is not an isolated case.

- Associated Community Services made 1.3 billion robocalls, soliciting money for moral causes (helping homeless veterans, breast cancer, children with autism) and not following through. $110 million USD was fraudulently claimed. https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/162-3208-associated-community-services-inc
- National Children's Leukemia Foundation took in around $9.7 million in charitable contributions, but according to CNN spent only $57,000 USD on assistance for leukemia patients. $1.3 million USD went directly to NCLF's founder. https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/21/us/new-york-charity-fraud/index.html
- The United States Navy Veterans Association fraudulently collected around $100 million USD in donations. Its founder claimed to have the support of multiple large foundations that didn't actually exist. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/16/scammer-28-year-sentence-navy-veterans-charity-fraud

Investors and donors would be more confident depositing money in funds that have a demonstrably clean track record. Users should have the ability to easily conduct market research and audit fund management. How do we ensure capital is securely deployed? With **Reputable**!

## ‚ùì What it does

**Reputable** is a platform that allows users to:
1. Easily onboard with WalletConnect for universal token and wallet acceptance and a discovery queue to find reputable funds.
3. Quickly determine the trustworthiness a fund with our reputation system (which considers transaction records, user reviews, and dispute resolution) and dashboard that shows fund activities. Soulbound NFT badges are granted to funds based on their reputation and activity.
4. Audit a fund by submitting a dispute on a transaction using UMA protocol. 

## üöß How we built it 

Technologies Used: The Graph, Worldcoin, Airstack, WalletConnect, UMA, 1inch Network, Uniswap Foundation, Gnosis Chain, Safe, Aave, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Axiom, Apecoin, Biconomy, QuickNode, Filecoin, Axelar

1. We are leveraging **([WorldCoin](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/WorldCoin.md))** to provide secure authentication login! (We want to make sure real people are filing disputes!)
   - User privacy is preserved using **([Polygon](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Polygon.md))**  ID's Verifiable Credentials  
   - Universal wallet acceptance made possible with **([WalletConnect](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/WalletConnect.md))**
      -   Compatible with **([Apecoin](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Apecoin.md))** 
   - Additionally, account abstraction is implemented using **([Biconomy](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Biconomy.md))**.

2. We leveraged **([Nouns](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Nouns.md))** to generate unique user profile pictures based on the user's reputation and to ensure protection of user identity
   
3. Soulbound NFTs fetched using **([QuickNode](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/QuickNode.md))**
          
4. NFT metadata is stored with **([IPFS](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/IPFS.md))**, so it never goes away 
   
5. Maintaince of reputations across all deploy networks powered by **([Axlear](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Axlear.md))**'s cross-chain communication

6. Gas fees estimated and transactions read using **([Safe](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Safe.md))**
   
7. We track transaction data on a variety of wallets using  **([AirStack](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Airstack.md))**
   - We leveraged **([1inch Network](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Airstack.md(https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/1inchNetwork.md))** so that users could easily swap tokens to invest in a fund of their chooisng

8. Deployed and fully functional on **([Arbitrum](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Arbitrum.md))**, **([Base](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Base.md))**, **([Mantle](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Mantle.md))**, and **([Neon EVM](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/NeonEVM.md))**
