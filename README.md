# üõ° Reputable 

#### Mission: Provide investors with an effective, yet simple interface to dispute publicy visible transactions

## üí° Inspiration 

**There are no good ways to determine whether a fund is trustworthy or to dispute management of a fund.** Just recently, in 2021, former Make-A-Wish Iowa CEO plead guilty to embezzling nearly *$41,000*. This is not an isolated case- other headlines suggest that this is a widespread issue:

* "FTC wants AmeriDebt founder to refund $172 million" (Ambrose 2005)
* "fAs charitable cheating rises, so does cost to taxpayers" (USA Today 2005) 
* "Tax Abuse Rampant in Nonprofits, IRS Says" (Crenshaw 2005) 

Although fund management can be especially helpful when it comes to tracking charities and non-profits, investors should also have the ability to audit fund management with any type of organization. So how do we ensure capital is confidently deployed? With **Reputable**! ü§ñ

## ‚ùì What it does

**Reputation** is a multipurpose, platform-agnostic tool that uses a quadratic voting and dispute/ranking based algorithm to determine the reputation of investors and investees. View ratings, submit disputes, and deploy capital from any chain.

## üöß How we built it 

Technologies Used: The Graph, Worldcoin, Airstack, WalletConnect, UMA, 1inch Network, Uniswap Foundation, Gnosis Chain, Aave, Polygon, Arbitrum, Scroll, Base, Axiom, Apecoin, Biconomy, QuickNode, Filecoin

1. We are leveraging **([WorldCoin](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/WorldCoin.md))** to provide secure authentication login! (We want to make sure real people are filing disputes!)
   - User privacy is preserved using **([Polygon](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Polygon.md))**  ID's Verifiable Credentials  
   - Universal wallet acceptance using **([WalletConnect](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/WalletConnect.md))**
   - Additionally, account abstraction is implemented using **([Biconomy](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Biconomy.md))**.

3. We leveraged **[Nouns](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/Nouns.md))'s NFT API** to create NFT badges representative of each fund.
   - NFTs minted using **([QuickNode](https://github.com/WilliamUW/ETHNYC/blob/main/sponsors/QuickNode.md)**
   - Unlock for membership NFTs, token gated access to investor only documentation **Unlock** **[unlock](link here)**
       - Based on reputation
       - Soulbound NFT if reputation gets too low     
     
5. NFT metadata is stored with IPFS, so it never goes away **[IPFS](link here)**
   
7. Universal token and chain support by leveraging Axelar's cross-chain communication  **[IPFS](link here)**
