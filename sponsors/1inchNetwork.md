### Please add a sentence or two on why you're applicable for this prize.

We leveraged 1inch Network so that users could easily swap tokens to invest in a fund of their chooisng. Using their Swap API allowed us to seemlessly find prices of quote assets, produce tx hashes, and optimize for slippage. Our platform democratizes investing and all users from all ecosystems should be empowered to engage with us.
