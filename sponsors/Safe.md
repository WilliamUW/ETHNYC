### Please add a sentence or two on why you're applicable for this prize.

We used Safe's Core API Kit to interact with the chain to estimate gas fees and read confirmed, pending, and incorming transactions. These insights provided our users with more accurate information regarding the transactions they executed for funds. Additionally, we utilized safe's cli to scrape the balances and histories of multisig wallets.

We also allow users to upload their own JSONs from the CLI to analyze.
